Among Us Watch Face/Faces
==========
The current project setup is copied off my other program (That I didn't finish). Just need to swap it over.

This is just a quick project to test out watch faces and ideas.

## Current Screenshots
Just mostly testing embedding images in github but also just to make a quick preview (ill try to keep it up to date)

## Plans
I am looking to make this into a fully functioning app with the basic Pomodoro features.
Possibly some more Fitbit apps down the road :D


# Some general Fitbit app development info/links
I thought this section would be helpful for links as well as for personal notes for me.

## Making a New Project
This took me a bit longer than it should have to find. Take a look at https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/#creating-a-new-project


### To connect the debugger
run `npm debug` then `connect phone` and `connect device` (though make sure they are not connected to any other processes e.g. Fitbit studio)

To install the project then run `build` then `install` or use `bi` to do both in one command.

You can also look at https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/ for more info
