Fitbit Productivity Timer (Pomodoro Timer)
==========

Based off https://github.com/roldanjr/pomatez

This project is a test app for fun. I have no intention of maintaining it, though it seems like it may be useful.

If you are looking to make an app of your own feel free to use this as a reference but take a look at
https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-app-demo/blob/main/package.json too.

You can also take a look in the fitbit studio for other presets https://studio.fitbit.com/.
If you are unsure about what to put in the package.json you can always make a base project then under download
choose export project and use that as a base.

# Making a New Project
This took me a bit longer than it should have to find. Take a look at https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/#creating-a-new-project

## To connect the debugger
run `npm debug` then `connect phone` and `connect device` (though make sure they are not connected to any other processes e.g. Fitbit studio)

To install the project then run `build` then `install` or use `bi` to do both in one command.

## Plans
I am looking to make this into a fully functioning app with the basic Pomodoro features.
Possibly some more Fitbit apps down the road :D
